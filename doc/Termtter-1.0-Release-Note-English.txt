Termtter 1.0 Released
Today March 15, 2009, we have released Termtter 1.0 as a stable version. Termtter is a twitter client software working on terminal emulators, which is very easy to extend functions. Termtter is the only one twitter client which can calculates fibonacci numbers congenitally.

== INSTALLATION
  sudo gem install termtter

== HOW TO USE
Termtter will ask you what are your twitter account(email) and password are when you boot termtter for the first time. Termtter will make a config file ~/.termtter/config and will boot. Now you can post messages to twitter by typing "u Hello, world!" and return key on the termtter.

Let's fix your ~/.termtter/config and try various plugins! You can post the 100th fibonacci number to twitter by (1) uncomment the line "plugin 'fib'" and reboot termtter and (2) type "fib 100" on the termtter.
